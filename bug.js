This error occurs when you are using a third party library in your React Native project and that library has some incompatibility with your current React Native version or other dependencies. The error message might not be very descriptive and you may need to investigate the dependency tree to find the culprit.

Example: Assume a library, 'react-native-awesome-library', is causing a conflict. Your package.json might look something like this:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native": "0.71.8",
    "react-native-awesome-library": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

And the error message in your console might be something vague like:

`Invariant Violation: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: object.`

The actual root cause might be buried deep within `react-native-awesome-library`'s dependencies.
