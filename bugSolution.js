The solution involves a careful examination of your project's dependency tree. You can use tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why` to visualize the dependencies and identify potential conflict points.

1. **Identify the conflicting library:** The error messages might point towards a specific library, but often the root cause is deeper. Use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to trace the dependency tree related to components throwing errors.

2. **Check library compatibility:** Ensure that all your third-party libraries are compatible with your React Native version. Check their respective documentation or GitHub repositories for compatibility information.

3. **Update or downgrade packages:** Try updating all your packages to their latest versions using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`. If that doesn't work, try downgrading potentially conflicting packages to older versions that are known to be compatible.

4. **Use a different library:** If you can't resolve the conflict, consider using an alternative library that offers similar functionality and is known to be more stable or compatible.

5. **Clean and rebuild:** Sometimes a clean build can resolve unexpected issues. Delete the `node_modules` folder and reinstall packages (`npm install` or `yarn install`).

Example of resolving the conflict (using the example from the bug description):

Check the `react-native-awesome-library`'s documentation for compatible React Native versions.  Let's say the solution involves downgrading to `react-native-awesome-library` version `0.5.0`.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native": "0.71.8",
    "react-native-awesome-library": "^0.5.0"
  }
}
```

Then run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
